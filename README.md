# Neural-network-by-hand
This is a neural network which can predict if a flower is red or blue based on its petal length. This project was made from scratch, doing all calculations manually without the use of any external machine learning libraries such as Pandas or TensorFlow. This program was written using Jupyter Notebook and made use of the Matplotlib library to illustrate the improvement in cost function, and to graph the boundary line on a scatterplot.
